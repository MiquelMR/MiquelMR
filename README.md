Hello, I’m @MiquelMR, a software developer based in Alicante, a sunny city in southeast Spain☀️.
 
I’m currently working with several programming languages and environments in the fields of software development, machine learning, and big data, and like many of us, I like to learn by practice, so I have written some code that I want to share.

My code has several purposes:
  - 🧑‍🎓 Just for practice or as an example of something I have learned
  - ⚙️ To be useful or interesting
  - 🏢 To showcase my work, knowledge, and skills for potential recruiters
