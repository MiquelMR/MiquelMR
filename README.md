Hello, I’m @MiquelMR, a software developer based on Alicante, a sunny city in south east Spain☀️.
 
I’m currently working with several software languages and environments around software development, machine learning, and big data, and as many of us, I like to learn by practice, so I have written some code which I want to share.

My code has several purposes:
  🧑‍🎓 Just practice or being an example of something I have learnt
  ⚙️ Being usefull or interesting
  🏢 Showing up my work, knowledge and skills for possible recruiters
